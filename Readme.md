## **Multi-Class Image Classification with Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow**
### **Introduction**
This project focuses on developing a multi-class image classification model using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow. The primary objective is to classify images into one of the ten classes provided by the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes categories such as dog, cat, airplane, fish, and more.

### **Dataset**
The `CIFAR-10` dataset is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. It is structured in a specific format that requires some preprocessing to convert it into a usable image format for our model.

### **Data Preparation**
- **Extracting Data:** The first step involves extracting the CIFAR-10 data from its batch files.
- **Correcting Image Dimensions:** After extraction, an additional step is necessary to correct the dimensions of the images, as described on the official CIFAR-10 dataset page.

### **Data Augmentation**
To enhance the dataset, data augmentation techniques were applied using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`. This step is crucial for improving the generalization of the model by introducing variations in the training data.

### **Feature Extraction**
Local features of the images were extracted using `Histogram of Oriented Gradients` (HOG) and `Local Binary Patterns` (LBP). These features help in capturing important characteristics of the images that aid in classification.

### **Model Training**
The VGG16 model was chosen for training the dataset. `VGG16` is a pre-trained model with a feature vector of size 1x1000, which is sufficient for this project.

### **Dimensionality Reduction**
Though optional, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the feature vector from 1000 to 256 dimensions to meet project guidelines and improve computational efficiency.

### **Model Evaluation and Saving**
The model was evaluated for its performance, and the final trained model was saved using Python's pickle module for future use.

### **User Interface**
A Streamlit interface was created to allow users to upload an image and receive its predicted class. The only requirement is that the image must have dimensions of 32x32x3.

### **How to Use**
- **Clone the Repository:** git clone `https://github.com/yourusername/multiclass-image-classification.git`
- **Install Dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

- **Run the Streamlit Interface:** streamlit run app.py
- **Upload an Image:** Use the provided interface to upload a 32x32x3 image and get the classification result.

### **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for multi-class image classification, from data preparation and augmentation to feature extraction, model training, and deployment with a user-friendly interface.
